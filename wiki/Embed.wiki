#summary How to embed the BeIT Memcached client in your project.

= Getting the code =
Simply download the source archive from the project home, or check out the files from svn from the project source page. Either way, you will get a complete Visual Studio 2005 solution which contains the client and some example code that shows how it's used.

= Embedding the code into your project =
You have multiple options for embedding the client in your code.
  * Copy all the .cs files to your project, include them, and make sure your project references System and System.Configuration.
  * Copy the entire BeIT Memcached project to your solution and include it.
  * Change the output type of the project to Class Library, compile, copy the resulting .dll to your project and include it.

= Using the code in your project =
The only class you need to access is the BeIT.MemCached.MemcachedClient class. Start by calling the static Setup method with a name and a list of memcached servers that the client should use. Then call the GetInstance method to get this instance of the client. On that object you can then call the various methods such as Set and Get to use the cache.

Check the [Example] page for more detailed usage info, and check the code itself for a complete list of all methods and their overloads.
