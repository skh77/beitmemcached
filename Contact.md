The BeIT Memcached client was developed by [Henrik Schr√∂der](mailto:skrolle@gmail.com) and Oliver Kofoed Pedersen for our company, [BeIT ApS](http://www.beit.dk).

We have used the client successfully in a number of consultancy projects, and we are using it extensively in our own latest product, [Nonoba](http://nonoba.com), a social gaming website.

If you have any questions or suggestions, just send an email to [skrolle@gmail.com](mailto:skrolle@gmail.com)
